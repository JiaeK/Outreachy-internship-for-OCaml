- going to rebase today & compile again
- we wanted to check how does it look like when the graphs reach 1000 data points:
  - in dream_dashboard.ml, [`let memory_list = My_metrics.memory_report () in`](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/3336a5b00d74674d6ee24944d87d92b7a16c0b4c/src/dream_dashboard/dream_dashboard.ml#L21) - we tested like, `let memory_list_5`, `let memory_list_25` - examined a lot of random data points 
- deleted TODOs -> opened an issue for that
- deleted images of logos
- rebase `style.css`
- checked `user agent` again - checked whether `parse` is working
- moved favicons to icons in layout_template.eml
- updated data policy
- checked loaders
- had a deployment issue - checked the opam repo - opened docker and updated docker opam-repo
- had an error with `hyper` -  checked and updated [dream-livereload](https://github.com/tmattio/dream-livereload)
