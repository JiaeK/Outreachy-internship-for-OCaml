- why we use [`alcotest`](https://github.com/mirage/alcotest) when there's compilers, explanation by Shon: 
  - testing libraries like alcotest - in this context, when we talk about "tests", we mean a program that is used to check whether another program behaves as expected.  For unit tests, the usual way of defining the test program is to write an executable that imports modules from the program we want to test, then calls functions from those modules to check whether they behave as expected
  - It is totally possible, and not at all unheard of, to define just as an executable that just depends on the libraries you want to test, and uses `assert` or thrown exception to cause a failure to alert us when a test has gone wrong
  - But there are lots of little features that you can add that writing and maintaining test programs easier, and especially to make the output from any failed tests more informative
    - E.g. instead of just crashing at the first `assert`, we might want all of our test cases to pass, then get a report of which ones failed and which ones succeeded. Usually you also want some pretty printed feedback about which values were expected and which values you actually got. It's also common to want to break tests up into subgroups
  - Test frameworks like alcotest provide all of these nice features. That saves each programmer having to reinvent their own testing utilities for each project
  - Although it gives us nice functions and data structures to use in our test programs, and defines a convenient CLI to use when we run the test program. In order to actually turn the test code we've written using alcotest, we still need to compile it
  - A command like `dune test` or `make test` generally just takes of (1) compiling the test program and (2) running it so we can see if the program we want to test behaves as expected



- optional argument is like, I can pass or not
- module private is the one only the developers can use and users can’t see
- We'll be using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding#add-padding-to-a-single-side) - generated by asset, can create css with html to write library
- Check [`scope`](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/basics/expressions.html?highlight=scope#scope) once again
- check Info.ocaml_version
- sometimes when you don’t do indentation in a right way, compiler also complains
- check ocaml dune [build_info.mli](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/blob/1c7412ce4168f83c5cad8cdddd72bc68dad825da/otherlibs/build-info/src/build_info.mli#L22)
